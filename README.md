# The Tower

An adventure game in Lua/Love2D, drawing inspiration from titles like 2D Zelda (A Link to the Past, Links Awakening) and Bastion, with a built-in engine and game editor

It's my final project in a Game Programming Course at [PUCPR] (http://www.pucpr.br/) in Brazil.

## Some of the features we want to implement in this project are:

* Both controller and keyboard support
* Game resource management (images and audio)
* Editors for simple objects, animations and maps
* 2D collision, with box and circle colliders, and collision trigger events
* Reasonable fast rendering, allowing many objects in scene (up to 10000, in initial tests)
* Simple lighting model, with light spots (lamps), shaded objects (normal maps) and casting shadows
* Automatic movement and navigation maps for IA elements (enemies)
* Simple scripting system
* Static cutscenes with editors (basically, image transitions and background sound/music)
